                <p class="lead"><b>Civil Engineering</b><br>Engineering is one of the oldest branch of engineering. As the name suggests, it is very much related to Civilians of a country, and it certainly has broader meanings. Civil Engineering is the application of practical and scientific knowledge for solving problems of the society, the progress of which is intricately linked to advances in understanding of physics and mathematics along with changing scenario of society. As the society grows and prospers, this branch will only increase in its demand value. </p>
                <p class="lead">It is a very common misconception that students at IITs are bookworms and the professors keep pestering them to study. This is not even close to the reality. In IITs, practical knowledge, lateral thinking, being able to apply the known facts and ability to solve problems, these things are more stressed upon. It is the perfect environment for you to explore yourself and the world. </p>
                <p class="lead">The Civil Engineering Department at IIT Ropar is very pragmatic and hard working, and ever ready to help its students. The faculty is highly experienced and always eager to share their immense knowledge with us. The course structures are designed such that what is taught in the class and related practical applications go together. This immensely helps in a much better understanding of the concepts. When it comes to maintaining a good grade, it is not much of a problem for a student of civil engineering if he or she is sincere and hardworking.
</p>
                

                <p class="lead">most attractive thing about this branch is that it is evergreen and will always be in demand. In the course of development of a country,  construction related work is never going to end, and so is the demand
