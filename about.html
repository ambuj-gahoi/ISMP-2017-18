            Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar (IIT Ropar) is one of the new IITs set up by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India. The foundation stone of the Institute was laid on 24th February 2009. The Institute is currently operating from a transit campus, occupied earlier by the Government Polytechnic for Women. Professor M.K. Surappa joined as the first Director of the institute in June, 2009, and Shri A. Palanivel joined as the first Registrar in July, 2009. These two areas of focus will enable students to gain exposure to recent trends in their chosen domains of study and practical experience through a wide variety of activities that the institute facilitates in its own campus and arranges for in collaboration with industry and other institutes. The Government of Punjab has allotted 501 acres of land on the banks of the river Satluj to IIT Ropar. When completed, the campus will be a self-contained township catering to all the needs of faculty, staff and students. At the transit campus, arrangements have been made for classes, laboratories, hostels and faculty accommodation. The institute will shift to the new campus in the coming semester. At present, the institute offers Bachelor of Technology (B. Tech.) programme in the following disciplines: Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering & Civil Engineering with a strength of forty, forty, forty & twenty five students respectively and is going to add Chemical Engineering under B.Tech programme in the next coming session.

            Institute Student Mentor Programme, (ISMP) is a student initiative, run by IIT Ropar, to make sure that the transition of freshmen into IITians is smooth and concurrently facitilate the growth of individials so that they can make informed decision when faced with decisions at IIT Ropar and further in their life. Every freshman joining IIT Ropar is assigned a mentor who will be a friendly guide for the fresher's at IIT Ropar and will help them analyze various options at different stages of IIT life.

            Mentors
            Mentors are second, third and fourth-year students at IIT Ropar who aid the induction of freshmen and their development process through the academic year. Mentoring is not only about the transfer of knowledge from a more experienced to a less experienced person through learning and dialogue, but also about being a good friend with whom a mentee may share all his hesitations and apprehensions.
            The mentors can be approached at any time of the day either by personally meeting them or by virtual means. Also every mentor maintains a group in Whatsapp or Facebook to ensure that maximum interaction is possible with little hesitation. Mentors will guide all the mentees throughout the year and it is where the latter get to learn a lot and become mentors in the forthcoming years

        <div id = 'f3'>
        Dear Students, 
            Congratulations on joining the IIT Ropar family. On behalf of the Institute, I welcome you all to IIT Ropar, a place where we celebrate youth and excellence and attempt to transform young persons into adults with a sense of social responsibility, human values and concern for environment. We not only strive to train the students to become excellent scientists, technologists, thinkers and leaders of the society, but also help them mould themselves into better human beings. To start with, a 4-year B.Tech programme is offered in four branches, viz., Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Civil engineering with a strength of 40, 40 ,40 & 25 students respectively. This year institute decided to add one more branch, Chemical Engineering, under B.Tech programme. The curriculum, course structure and syllabus for the first year courses are similar to (but may not be identical to) that in IIT Delhi. We hope that you would use this opportunity to realize your full potential and bring out the best in you. We are sure that the excellent academic environment and the opportunity to participate in co-curricular activities will also help you in developing your personality and in your all-round development. I believe that your education in IIT Ropar will be a fulfilling experience. There would be of course times when you might feel lonely and stressed, especially during the initial phase of your stay here. During these times, I will strongly suggest that you should not hesitate in seeking help from your student mentor, faculty advisor or the Institute Counselor. We will make a genuine attempt in assisting you during the time of your trials and tribulations. We have also set up a special Help Desk for IIT Ropar to help you resolve your problems, through the voluntary efforts of some of our faculty and staff members. You can approach this help desk at any time during your stay at the IIT Ropar campus to address any of your concerns regarding either academic matters or life in the campus. In case of special needs, you are also welcome to seek the help of the Dean of Student Affairs or the Dean of Academic and Research. I sincerely hope that your academic pursuit in IIT Ropar will be fruitful and enjoyable in every aspect and the experiences you gain here and the moments you spend here will be cherished by you all your life. Wishing you the very best, (Sarit K. Das)</div>

            1. Recognize that mentoring in IIT ROPAR is focused on building a lasting relationship and sharing information.
    <br>
<br>
2. During the initial stages of the programme, your mentee may appear hesitant and unresponsive to your help. The mentee's attitude will take a positive turn over time and after sincere efforts from your end. Be patient!
<br>    <br>

3. Remember there is an initial phase to every relationship. In the early stages, a freshman is interested in knowing how sincere and 'real' you are. Establish a means of communication at the earliest.
<br>    <br>

4. Conduct regular mentor meetings during the initial phase. Inform him of all the activities that take place in IIT especially those recommended for freshmen.
<br>    <br>
5. Consider conducting the mentor meetings in the Common Room/ Mess Hall and not in private, at least during the first month or so (for freshmen). Understand that there is a civilized timing for this meeting, and it should not extend to late night.
<br>    <br>

6. Advise your mentee of complaint procedures in case of an undue approach or an instance of ragging. Remember his insecurities are heightened by the fact of him being in a new environment.
<br>    <br>

7. Don't try to be a teacher, parent, therapist or babysitter. Present the information carefully and without any distortion and give all possibilities and solution a fair hearing, without passing a judgement. Suggest ways to solve the problem together, rather than lecture the mentee.
Remember: “Your role is to respond to the mentee's needs, not impose your agenda.”
<br>    <br>

8. Respect the integrity of your mentee and influence him through constructive feedback. If you have a concern which you believe is beyond your ability to handle, call the MRC Coordinators even if it is trivial one. 
<br>    <br>

9. Do not give your mentee the silent treatment. Discuss your and his concerns.
<br>    <br>

10. On a very rare occasion you may need to inform the mentee's parents of any unacceptable behaviour. Before doing this, get in touch with the MRC Coordinators and a professor.
<br>    <br>

11. Don't make judgements concerning a family conflict or heightened situation.Leave the parenting to the parent.
<br>    <br>

12. If you are informed that your mentee's safety or safety of another is jeopardised, report this concern to the MRC Coordinators, Hostel Caretaker and Warden or a professor immediately.
<br>    <br>

13. As has been seen, mentors have a great deal of impact however, it is not immediately evident. Look for signs: like increased attendance, higher CGPA, timely showing up for mentor meetings and freely expressing appreciation.
<br>    <br>

14. Mentors and mentees will be asked to complete evaluations provided by the Mentorship Committee (MRC). The evaluations will be recorded on an electronic database. This is to ensure that expected standards are met, and to realise ways in which the programme can be further improved during the year and subsequently, over the years to come.
<br>    <br>

15. If you are unhappy about experiences associated with the ISMP or any of its policies, you are requested to speak to the MRC Coordinators.

                The institute, apart from establishing a robust teaching environment, is keen to facilitate and support cutting-edge research in variety of areas. This aspect, we believe, will enable the students to acquaint themselves with latest developments in their respective areas of study and peruse their own research interests. This would also result in a constant revision of courses that are being taught. The institute encourages its faculty members to initiate research work and provides an initiation grant and also the basic facilities for its sustenance. It also encourages faculty members to establish collaborative research ventures with other research labs and industry. In this regard, the institute is keen to establish the Central Research Facility. The institute has already started its PhD Programme, so that the research environment is further augmented, expanded, and made even more vibrant.
